# Cake Shop Application
An app for managing the stocks of a cake shop. It lets you add/remove/modify a stock, filter the stocks by name (starting letter), 
by price and sorting them.

## What I Learned

* Pointers and dynamic memory allocation and how to avoid mistakes like dangling pointers or memory leaks
* Generic C programming using void pointers (void*)
* Implemented dynamic vector structure
* Test driven development using assert function (from assert.h)
